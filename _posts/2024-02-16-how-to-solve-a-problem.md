# Problem

Let's build a service allowing customers to upload an image, apply a chosen filter to it, and then receive the modified image in return.

# Motivation

I postulate this as an introspective thought exercise aimed at uncovering and comprehending the knowledge disparities among engineers at varying levels of impact. This exercise was inspired by the famous [Feynman Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching), yet adapting it to align with the progression narrative of a technical career, this exercise encourages introspection on one's career journey and the expansion of one's impact.

In this reflective exercise, I encourage participants to envision solutions to the specific question from the perspectives of four distinct roles:

- Software Engineer
- Senior Software Engineer
- Tech Lead
- Uber Tech Lead
- ...

The objective is not to evaluate individuals based on their position or experiences but to encourage self-reflection on the evolution of one's understanding throughout their career trajectory. This exercise serves as a tool to bridge the gap between "what I think a `insert_your_next_career_ladder_role` does" and "what `insert_your_next_career_ladder_role` does and their responsibilities are". This realization emerged from navigating the often ambiguous career advancement advice to "amplify your impact" or "increase your productivity"

I recommend documenting your personal responses to the question and sharing them publicly for constructive feedback. This not only fosters a culture of learning and growth but also offers a unique opportunity to reflect on your progress and understanding as you advance in your career.

# Solution

Haha, caught you! I highly suggest you give this exercise a try on your own before seeking out possible solutions. Discovering the gaps in your knowledge firsthand could be incredibly beneficial. However, if you've already done this, feel free to offer your critique of my approach [here](tbd)
